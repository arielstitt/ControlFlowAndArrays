## Q + A
1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
2. How do we change the value of a variable?
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?

### Research 

5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?

6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?

## Strings

**For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the app.js folder under it's respectice section** 

- Create a variable called firstVariable
- Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
- Change the value of this variable to some number
- Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
- Change the value of secondVariableto any string.

What is the value of firstVariable?

- Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string `"Hello, my name is "` and the variable yourName. 

ex output: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean

## Booleans

Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print truein the console. Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things that don't make sense but happen to print true to the console:

  `const a = 4;`
  `const b = 53;`
  `const c = 57;`
  `const d = 16;`
  `const e = 'Kevin';`
 

  `console.log(a __ b);`
  `console.log(c __ d);`
  `console.log('Name' __ 'Name');`
  
  ### // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||

  `console.log(true __ false);`
  `console.log(false __ false __ false __ false __ false __ true);`
  `console.log(false __ false)`
  `console.log(e ___ 'Kevin');`
  `console.log(a __ b ___ c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)`
  `console.log(a __ a ___ d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"`
  `console.log(48 __ '48');`
